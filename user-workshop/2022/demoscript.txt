======================================================

(1) STAGE A SMALL LIST OF 50 FILES (so they complete) THEN RELEASE and CLEAR.


- ARCHIVE INFO with the release paths, should show TAPE
- SUBMIT
- GET - to see whether they have completed
- ARCHIVE INFO to check

- ADMIN interface to check for pinning:  
(no way to get info about the actual pinned state through REST)

request info (gives equiv of GET)
target ls -l -rid=

pick a path

\sn pnfsidof
\s Pin Manager ls 

- RELEASE

\s Pin Manager ls 

- DELETE
- GET should return error

======================================================

(2) STAGE A LIST OF 9900 FILES, THEN CANCEL 1000.  FINALLY, CANCEL THE WHOLE, AND CLEAR.

- SUBMIT
- GET
- CANCEL with paths
- GET
- CANCEL
- GET
- DELETE
- GET should return error

======================================================

(3) QOS TRANSITION.  A DIRECTORY OF RESILIENT (TWO COPIES) FILES WILL BE MOVED TO TAPE:
	FILES WILL BE MIGRATED FOR FLUSH, AND THEIR COPIES CACHED.

- ARCHIVE INFO to show all DISK [prepare paths]

\sn pnfsidof <path>
\sn storageinfoof should show REPLICA ONLINE
\sn cacheinfoof 
\s pools rep ls shoudl show sticky

- SUBMIT
- GET (you will see status completed fairly quickly, because flush returns)
- ARCHIVE INFO probably will still show DISK at this point

ADMIN interface:  

\sn storageinfoof should show NEARLINE CUSTODIAL
\sn cacheinfoof
\s pools rep ls should show cached + precious

A look at the qos components:

\s qos-verifier verify history
\s qos-adjuster info
\s qos-adjuster task details

CLEAR ALL REQUESTS!

(4) IN THE ADMIN INTERFACE, DO PRESTORE vs NO PRESTORE USING LOG_TARGET
