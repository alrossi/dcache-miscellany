1.  need for something like /etc/voms
2.  need to make sure you can interoperate with voms 
	(write with voms, read with token, e.g.)
3.  group-based authorization (RUCIO)
	reviewed Andrea's slides for RUCIO-FTS token exchange
	problem of adding group-based
	FTS does not yet target audiences, but does token exchange
	user-based exchange is supported in RUCIO
	so, to make it group-based:  (a) RUCIO honors group-based info in IAM
				     (b) how to handle this in FTS

	idea is eventually move from group- to scope-based?

	objective:  derive audience from URL user specifies, not too complicated, 
		    a substring of what user would provide

	RUCIO uses token exchange with group info to get a proper token for FTS
	does it also request a refresh? or leave that to FTS?
	it does (for safety)

	in addition to requesting scopes, it requests groups

	most of this logic should be there in services; the frontend is just changing

	SUGGESTED CHANGE TO IAM.  If you don't request scope during exchange, 
	it should preserve the original scope.  Most of the time an exchange 
	has to do with audience?  [this is for group-based].
	With scope-based, you change scopes, with group-based, you expand the scope.  (offline_access)


401 unauthorized for audience-based.
403 should be for permission



QUESTION FOR DCACHE TPC:  SHOULD THE TPC CLIENT REVALIDATE TOKEN? OR IS THAT THE SERVICE'S/DOOR'S BUSINESS?


4.  local user mapping (EOS)
    ORG->user account
    We have established mapping mechanisms (i.e., LCMAPS, Argus) 
	to map X509 certificates and VOMS attribute information to local UNIX accounts.

    Do we need a similar mapping mechanism also for tokens? 
	What are the requirements that have emerged up to now? Can we have a common approach?
